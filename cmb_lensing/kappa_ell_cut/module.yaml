explanation: |
    "It is often useful to apply a maximum or minimum ell cut to a CMB lensing map before measuring correlation functions with galaxies and shears.  If such an ell-cut is applied, we must account for it on the modeling side.  This module applies the lmin/lmax cut to the relevant cross-power spectra."
