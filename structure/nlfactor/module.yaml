rules:
    "It assumes the nonlinearity of the target spectrum is due to the nonlinearity of the matter perturbation. You should also make sure that the linear k_h is not in a narrower range than the nonlinear k_h. Target nonlinear pk will be truncated to the nonlinear matter power k_h range."

assumptions:
    - It assumes the nonlinearity of the target spectrum is due to the nonlinearity of the matter perturbation.

explanation: |
    This module multiplies the target_section by the nonlinear boost (matter_power_nl/matter_power_lin).
# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    linear_section: "The name of linear matter power spectrum section (default names.matter_power_lin)"
    nonlinear_section: "The name of nonlinear matter power spectrum section (default names.matter_power_nl)"
    target_section: "The name of target linear power spectrum section (default 'weyl_curvature_spectrum')"

#Inputs for a given choice of a parameter, from the values.ini or from other modules
#If no such choices, just do one of these omitting mode=something part:
