"""
This module loads data from the powtable files which summarize the simulation
results made by Hunjing Huang et al.

This is justified from OWLS module in cosmosis standard library.

I interpolate into that data using a bivariate spline to get an estimate of the
effect on the matter power from baryons at a given z and k.

I could have made mistakes here easily in understanding what is happening!
