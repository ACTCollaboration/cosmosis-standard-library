assumptions:
    - Pk_baryonic/Pk_nonlinear = Pk_hydro/Pk_DMonly

explanation: |
    "This module reads in Pk_nonlinear from previous modules modifies it, applying
    the ratio between DM-only and hydro simulations"

params:
    ratiotable: "Path to one of the ratio files supplied with in the module's data directory"

inputs:
    matter_power_nl:
        z: "1D real array, redshifts of samples"
        k_h: "1D real array, inpu k wavenumbers of samples in Mpc/h."
        p_k: "2D real array, matter power spectrum at samples in (Mpc/h)^-3."

outputs:
    matter_power_nl:
        p_k: "2D real array, matter power spectrum at samples in (Mpc/h)^-3, modified in-place"
