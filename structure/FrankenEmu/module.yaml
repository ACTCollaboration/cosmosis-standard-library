explanation: |
    "
    FrankenEmu is an emulator designed to interpolate among a collection
    of numerical N-body simulations called the Coyote Universe.

    It uses a Gaussian Process interpolation between a set of simulations
    arranged in a Latin Hypercube in parameter space.

    Each simulation yields a non-linear matter power spectrum P(k,z), and
    the interpolation is between these spectra, so the output should be a
    reasonable (1% accuracy) value of P(k,z) for the given parameters.

    The simulations and the whole process are explained in detail in the papers
    above.
