        "This simple module calculates the linear growth factor D, and linear growth rate, f, for flat cosmology with either const w or variable DE eos w(a) = w + (1-a)*wa. 
        Where D, f are defined by the growth of a
         linear perturbation, delta, with scale factor a: delta(a') = delta(a)*(D(a')/D(a)) and f = dlnD/dlna"
