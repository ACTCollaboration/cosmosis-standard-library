assumptions:
-   Linear extrapolation in log-space of P(k); this is not a great approximation

explanation: |
    It is sometimes useful to extend matter power spectra P(k) to high values
    of k. These values are unphysical but are useful for numerical stability.

    This module does a simple linear extrapolation in log-log space of P(k)
    out to a specified kmin and kmax.  If the data already extends that far then
    it does not do anything.

    It tries both linear and non-linear spectra but does not complain if either or 
    both are not present.
