assumptions:
-   Gaussian window in redshift

explanation: |
    "This very simple module sets up fixed redshift n(z) bins for weak lensing.
     We should probably upgrade it to take the redshift and sigma from the 
     sampling instead of the ini file."
params:
    z:
        meaning: Real scalar or vector; redshift(s) of the bins
        type: ???
        default:
    sigma:
        meaning: Real scalar or vector; width of the bins in redshift

            meaning: Number of redshift samples

            meaning: Number of bins

            meaning: ; n(z) at redshift sample values.  bin_1, bin_2, ...
