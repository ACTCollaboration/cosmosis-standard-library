assumptions:
-   Underlying true number density has Smail distribution
-   Photometric errors are sigma(z) = sigma_0 (1+z)
-   Bias fixed with redshift (if included)
-   Galaxies evenly divided between bins

explanation: |
    "This module takes inputs that specify the underlying spectroscopic (true) redshift
    distribution of the galaxies in the survey.  It then convolves this with a photometric
    error sigma(z) = sigma_0 (1+z) and optionally biases it.  It computes bin edges in the
    survey assuming equal numbers in each.

    We might wish to add an option to specify fixed bin edges instead?
