#This is a template for module description files
name: load_nz
version: 1
purpose: Load a number density n(z) for weak lensing from a file

rules: If you use a file from a particular survey you should cite that survey

assumptions:
-   n(z) file first column = z, others = bin n(z)

explanation: |
    "This simple module just loads a set of n(z) for different bins from a
    fixed file and provides it as-is.  The n(z) are normalized before being saved."
params:
    filepath:
        meaning: Absolute or relative path to an n(z) file
        type: str
        default:
    des_fmt:
        meaning: ; use the DES format n(z) with columns zmin, zmax, nz1, nz2...
        type: bool
        default: false
    histogram:
        meaning: ; Assume that the given z values are lower edges of histogram bins,
            not sample points.
        type: bool
        default: false
    output_section:
        meaning: Default ''wl_number_density''. The section to which to save the output.
        type: str
        default:
inputs: {}
outputs:
    output_section:
        nz:
            meaning: Number of redshift samples. By default all these will go in wl_number_density.
            type: int
        nbin:
            meaning: Number of bins
            type: int
        z:
            meaning: ; redshift sample values
            type: real 1d
        bin_:
            meaning: ; n(z) at redshift sample values.  bin_1, bin_2, ...
            type: real 1d
