explanation: |
    " Supernova IA can be used as standardisable candles,
    letting us estimate a redshift-distance relation.

    The Pantheon sample collected together a combined SN IA
    sample from the Pan-Starrs1, Medium Deep Survey, SDSS,
    SNLS, and various HST data sets into a joint analysis.

    This module uses that data set to constrain the distance modulus
    vs redshift relation.

    There are two Pantheon data variants - this version uses the
    compressed (binned) version since it is much smaller and faster
    to use and produces nearly identical results to the full version.
    You can separately download and use the full version files if you
    wish.

    The Pantheon data release was analyzed with a much more complex code
    in CosmoMC, but almost all of the machinery in that code was unusued,
    because the various systematic effects that it implements were subsumed
    into a single systematic covariance matrix.  This code therefore omits
    that machinery for simlicitiy.
