        "This module computed the likelihood of D_v using eBOSS DR14
        measurement from QSO. 
        This class inherits from the lrg likelihood class.
        We assume the likelihood on D_v is Gaussian."
params:
        feedback: "Integer,amount of output to print.  0 for no feedback.  1 for basic (default = 0)"
inputs: 
        distances:
                z: "1D real array, redshifts of samples"
                rs_zdrag: "real, value of predicted drag redshift "
                d_m: "1D real array, physical angular diameter distance in Mpc"
                h:  "1D real array, hubble parameter with in units of Mpc"
outputs:
        likelihoods:
                eboss14_qso_like: "real, likelihood of Dv(z=1.52)"
