-   WMAP 9 year data

explanation: |
    "The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe measured the temperature
    and polarization of the CMB over the full sky in the K, Ka, Q, V, and W
    microwave bands.  

    The WMAP produced this likelihood code, which takes in theory spectra
    for TT, EE, BB, and TE spectra and compares it to WMAP data.

    The method used for the likelihood is different in different ell regimes
    and for different spectra.
