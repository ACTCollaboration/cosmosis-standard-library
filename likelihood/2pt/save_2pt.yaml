explanation: |
    "This module, which is typically run at the end of a cosmosis pipeline,
    saves the results of that pipeline as a 2pt FITS file which can then be used
    in a likelihood later.

    The typical forecasting workflow is to simulate some observations using this module and the test
    sampler, and then run another pipeline, often the same but with the last module changed
    from save_2pt to 2pt_like, to analyze the that simulated observation.

params:
    spectrum_sections: "string, Space-separated list of sections to look in for data, e.g. 'shear_cl shear_xi_plus galaxy_cl'"
    output_extensions: "string, default=spectrum_sections) Names of FITS extensions to save the chosen spectra to"
    theta_min: "real, minimum angular scale for real-space outputs.  If found then run will use real-space correlations.  Otherwise ell_min is required"

    angle_units: "string, name of angular unit used in theta_min, theta_max, one of arcsec, arcmin, deg, rad. default=arcmin"
    ell_min: "integer, minimum angular wavenumber for Fourier-space outputs.  Required if theta_min not set."
    ell_max: "integer, maximum angular wavenumber for Fourier-space outputs. Also used if real-space covariances are required as the max ell in that calculation."
    n_ell: "integer, number of ell values to use for Fourier-space outputs."
    logspaced: "bool, whether to use log-spacing in the output values (default=T)"

    fsky: "real, if make_covariance=T then the sky fraction to assume for the survey"
    upsample_cov: "int, For real-space covariances, boost in number of points cov used for calculation. (default=10)"
    high_l_filter: "real, filter used in real-space cov calculation (default=0.75)"

    overwrite: "bool, whether to overwrite the output file if it exists already"
    angle_range_{name}_{i}_{j}: "2 real values, For choices of {name} in output_extensions or spectrum_sections, min and max values to save for bin pair i,j"

        NOTE: "The name of both the section depends on the data type used from the file. It might be galaxy_cl or shear_cl, for example."
        ell: "If a Fourier-space measurement is used, the angular wave-number of the predicted theory curves."
        theta: "If a real-space measurement is used, the angle in radians of the predicted theory curves."
        bin_{i}_{j}: "For various i,j depending what is found in the file, the theory predictions for this value. For example, C_ell or xi(theta)"
