assumptions:
-   Highly accurate CMB calculations are required
-   In the high-ell regime models for the foregrounds and secondary anisotropies are
    assumed

explanation: |
    "See the Planck2015 module for general information about Planck.

    This module provides a greatly simplified form of the Planck likelihood supplied
    in plik_lite_v18_TT.clik, which should not be used for high-precision cosmology
    but should be alright for e.g. Fisher matrix forecasting.

    It turns the data in that file into just a Gaussian likelihood, ignoring the nuisance
    parameter.
