explanation: >
        "This module computes the likelihood of Dm and Dh using eBOSS DR16
        measurement from Lyman alpha, auto and cross correlations. 
        These have only geometric information (no RSD). 

        This module computes the combined likelihoods of cross and auto.

params:
        feedback: "Boolean, amount of output to print.  False for no feedback (default).  True for basic."

inputs: 
        distances:
                z: "1D real array, redshifts of samples"
                rs_zdrag: "real, value of predicted drag redshift "
                d_m: "1D real array, physical angular diameter distance in Mpc"
                h:  "1D real array, hubble parameter with in units of Mpc"
outputs:
        likelihoods:
                eboss16_lya_like: "real, likelihood of Dh and Dm at z=2.34"
