explanation: >
        "This module computes the likelihood of Dm_over_rd and Dh_over_rd for BAO-only analysis and Dm_over_rd, Dh_over_rd, and fsigma8 for BAO+FS analysis, both using eBOSS DR16 measurements from QSO. 
        We assume likelihoods are Gaussian."
params:
        feedback: "Boolean, amount of output to print.  False for no feedback (default).  True for basic."
        mode: "Integer, type of analysis. 0 for BAO-only. 1 for BAO + Full-shape"
