assumptions:
    - "Non-Gaussian likelihood"

explanation: 
        "This module computes the likelihood of Dv_over_rd for BAO-only analysis and Dm_over_rd, Dh_over_rd, 
        and fsigma8 for BAO+FS analysis, both using eBOSS DR16 measurements from ELG."
params:
        feedback: "Boolean, amount of output to print.  F for no feedback (default).  T for basic."
        mode: "Integer, type of analysis. 0 for BAO-only. 1 for BAO + Full-shape"

inputs: 
        distances:
                z: "1D real array, redshifts of samples"
                rs_zdrag: "real, value of predicted drag redshift "
                d_m: "1D real array, physical angular diameter distance in Mpc"
                h:  "1D real array, hubble parameter with in units of Mpc"
        growth:
                z: "1D real array, redshifts of samples"
                fsigma8: "1D real array, matter growth parameter (if mode = 1)"
        data:
                sdss_DR16_ELG_BAO_DVtable.txt: "table, a grid of the relative probability as function of Dv_over_rd at zeff = 0.845 (if mode = 0)"

outputs:
        likelihoods:
