assumptions:
    - "Cosmological parameters include w and wa."

explanation: |
    This module imposes a the requirement that  w_0+w_a<0, which
    ensures that w(a)= w_0 + (1-a)w_a  is always negative. 

    This is useful because it allows us to avoid computational problems that
     CAMB (and possibly other boltzman codes) has when the dark energy 
     equation of state becomes positive.

    This module checks whether w_0+w_a<0. If that condition is  
    fulfilled, the module does nothing. If w_0+w_a>=0, the module returns 1, 
    which will cause cosmosis samplers to throw out the point and skip the 
    rest of the pipeline for that sample.


params:
    verbose: "(bool) print an error message noting when points fail the w_0+w_a<0 requirement"

inputs:
    cosmological_parameters:
        w: "(real scalar) dark energy equation of state at z=0 (w_0)"
        wa: "(real scalar) linear coefficient of dark energy equation of state on scale factor"

outputs: {}
