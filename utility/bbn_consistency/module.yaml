explanation: |
    "
    The Big Bang Nucleosynthesis model describes how the 
    light elements were generated in the primordial universe.  For a given
    value of Omega_b h**2 and number of neutrinos the theory can predict
    the helium abundance.

    This module sets the helium mass fraction (YHe) from the mean baryon density (ombh2)
    and number of neutrinos (delta_neff), based on a table interpolation from those calculations.

    This module should go into the pipeline after consistency and
    before any physics modules. It's effectively an optional consistency module.
