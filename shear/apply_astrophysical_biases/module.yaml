    "
    Measurement of the matter power spectrum from real data relies on the visible positions and shapes of galaxies.
    Real galaxies offer a window onto the underlying mass distribution but an imperfect one. Due to a variety of 
    astrophysical processes in their formation and interaction history, the visible mass of galaxies is offset from
    the dark matter. Additionally, the precise relationship between their shapes and the total mass is dependent on 
    the details of how galaxies obtain intrinsic ellipticities. One can parameterise ignorance of these processes 
    using a series of scale and time dependent biases, which map the matter power spectrum onto the observable
    fields.
