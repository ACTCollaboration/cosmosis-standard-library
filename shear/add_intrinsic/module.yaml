name: add_intrinsic
version: '1.0'
purpose: Sum together intrinsic aligments with shear signal

assumptions:
-   Linear sum of C_ell for IA components

explanation: |
    Observerd shape spectra contain a sum of intrinsic and shear spectra, and the
    cross-correlation between them.  This module adds together these components,
    accounting for the fact that C_GI != C_IG for two bins

    It may be replaced at some point with changes to the shear computation modules.
